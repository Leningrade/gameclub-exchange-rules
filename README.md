# Eddy & Manny's Game Exchange Club Rules

A simple club dinamic to help you discover games that you would otherwise not 
play. Afterall the best critics of your taste are your friends.


# V.0.0.1
## Mechanics
**if a rule does not work for your group, house rules superseed anything recommended**

We recommend one of the following to better improve the odds of finding something new:

1. Random: each player brings a recommendation that follows the rules into the session. You collect all to form a recommendation pool. Each player is assigned a random game from the pool.
2. Secret Santa: Each week, each player is assigned another to whom they will have to make a recommendation next session. The recommended game has to follow the same pool rules.
3. Round Robin: Similar to the secret santa, The main difference is that each player can only recommend to each other only once, and player-matching is organized in a rotating fashion. ( i.e. session 1 A->B, B->C C->A; Session2  A->C, B->A, C->B; etc ) 

## Pool Rules
1. Minimum 4 hours completiton time per game
2. Max 40 hours per game
3. An accumulated maximum of 450 hours of game time per year
4. Games must be 1 player focused
